{"id":4980,"title":"Let Me Go","body":"[Verse 1]\nLock me up, lock me up, only way to keep me\nLock me up, lock me up, and push me into deep sea\nI know, I know there's no escape in you, oh (Mm, mm)\n \n[Verse 2]\nDrowning, stumbling, taking breaths in this cold water\nI'm hoping to see the shore\nBut with every move I sing more\nWhy can't you let go? Why can't you let go?\n \n[Pre-Chorus]\nThe distance seem so small\nBut still, I have to, still I pray to God\nYou let me go\n \n[Chorus]\nI pray to God, you let me go (Just let me... I pray to...)\nI pray to God, you let me go (Just let me... I pray to, I pray to God)\nI try, I try to leave, but every time you\nYou make me, make me bleed\nWhen try to push through\nI pray to God, I pray to God\nYou let me go (Just let me, just let me, I pray to)\n \n[Verse 3]\nThis is good, mouth is dried out\nAnd there's nothing else to say here\nI'm putting on the disguise\nJust so I could keep you in the lines\nWhy can't you let go? (Go, oh)\nWhy can't you, you let go? Mm, hmm\n \n[Verse 4]\nI can't explain why\nYou make me weak underneath some cotton\nNow please, just to keep me inside\nBuild me up and knock me down\nBut no one hears the sound\nNow, I want you to cry\nI want you begging for mercy\nHopping you're worthy, screaming you're sorry\nEverything's blurry, then maybe you'll see\nI mean my best\n \n[Chorus]\nWhen I pray to God, you let me go (Just let me... I pray to...)\nI pray to God, you let me go (Just let me... I pray to, I pray to God)\nI try, I try to leave, but every time you\nYou make me, make me bleed\nWhen try to push through\nI pray to God, I pray to God\nYou let me go (Just let me, just let me, I pray to)\n \n[Outro]\nJust let me go","bodyLyrics":"Lock me up, lock me up, only way to keep me\nLock me up, lock me up, and push me into deep sea\nI know, I know there's no escape in you, oh (Mm, mm)\n\nDrowning, stumbling, taking breaths in this cold water\nI'm hoping to see the shore\nBut with every move I sing more\nWhy can't you let go?
