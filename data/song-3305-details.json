{"id":3305,"title":"Summer Night","body":"I\u2019m waking up on Sunday morning, it\u2019s 9am\r\nWith sunshine in my hair in this last summer morning\r\nI don\u2019t want to stay at home, everything annoys me now\r\nI don\u2019t care the streets are quiet, anyway I\u2019m getting out\r\n\r\nSummer heat is almost over, I don\u2019t have to be so sad\r\nIt\u2019s impossible to steal all the memories I had\r\nIt\u2019s not too late to feel emotions, bring them back to life\r\nSo I call all my friends to take them with me, to celebrate\r\n\r\nI want my summer back tonight without any worries\r\nI want my summer back with you, to make new love stories\r\nI want my summer back tonight without any worries\r\nI want my summer back with you, to make new love stories\r\n\r\nI see my friends are smiling at me, it\u2019s 9pm\r\nThe party\u2019s almost started, we are going to the beach\r\nFaraway the beacon light is leading ships into the night\r\nWe are all in this together, to celebrate last summer night\r\n\r\nAs we dance along the beach, leaving footprints in the sand\r\nClinking glasses of champagne we say together cheers!\r\nIt\u2019s not too late to feel emotions, bring them back to life\r\nSo I call all my friends to take them with me, to celebrate\r\n\r\nI want my summer back tonight without any worries\r\nI want my summer back with you, to make new love
